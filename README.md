## ðŸ“œ Description
<br>
Stellar Variability AR is a filter that consists of augmented reality technology, being an alternative to get closer to users of social networks in a dynamic and relaxed way, in order to carry out scientific dissemination in a scalable way due to the ease of sharing the content offered. by these media. For this, the social media algorithm will be used in favor of dissemination, which allows tracking the profile of the user who would like to receive this type of information and classifying this content based on their behavior and what would be relevant, prioritizing the user's interest. .

## ðŸ’» Technologies used
--> Software Spark AR Studio (Version v143) for the creation of the filter using augmented reality
<br>
--> Plane Tracker 
<br>
--> Gyroscope/Accelerometer (allows you to rotate and explore the environment in 360Â°)
<br>
--> Volumetric Light (image manipulation technique that consists of giving volume to light)
<br>
--> Distortion (distorting objects through textures such as noises)
<br>
--> Rendering (of scenes and objects, allowing you to edit them)
<br>

Through augmented reality technology, a three-dimensional plane was implemented, where a 3D image will be received on the spatial plane where the device's camera will be pointed, in addition to information about three stars. Due to the fact that the filter is introduced through popular platforms with a large number of active users daily, it takes into account the ease of learning where each user can easily interact with the product, performing various tasks without deviating from the path, maintaining a learning experience. consistent and understandable. In this way, it is believed to obtain good efficiency and effectiveness to achieve a high level of user satisfaction.

## ðŸ“ˆ Example of use
When accessing the Instagram platform, access the stories and scroll to the side and find the filter, tap the filter and point your device's camera at a wide place to view augmented reality and interact with the tool.
